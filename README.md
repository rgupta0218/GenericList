# GenericList
# In this project I implemented my own versions of stack and queue data structures.
# In this simplified version, each data structure is a singly linked list.
# The implementation is generic as to allow different types when each data structure object is instantiated. 
# Also implement the Iterator design  pattern; allowing users access to a custom Iterator for your data structures.
